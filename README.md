# TTT-Rollermine
*This is content for the game Garry's Mod*

This is a TTT traitor weapon, useful for discouraging players from staying in parts of the map.

The rollermines will attack fellow traitors, so make sure to warn your teammates!
Although rollermines will move towards the person who threw them, they will not do any damage and will not collide with the player.

Shooting rollermines won't do any damage but will knock them back.
Water or explosions must be used to destroy rollermines.

Using the Poltergeist weapon on a rollermine can be quite devastating...
